# Practice Projects

This repository is a collection of my personal coding projects, developed to learn and experiment with different programming concepts, libraries, and technologies. I'm currently exploring OpenCV and PyGame as I learn well through things explored visually.

## Projects

### [Bad Apple ASCII](./Bad-Apple-ASCII/)

A Python script that converts the iconic "Bad Apple!!" video into an ASCII art animation, rendering it frame-by-frame in the console using PyGame.

**Libaries used:** OpenCV, PyGame
